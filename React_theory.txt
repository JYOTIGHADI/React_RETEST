1. What is React, and why is it used for building user interfaces?
ans=react is the javascript libraty used to build the user interfaces and it is a single page applications, and it is also a component based and 
declarative its also allow to efficient ui updates using a virtual DOM
it help to developer create fast and interactive web apps using reusable components.



2. Explain the concept of the Virtual DOM and how it improves performance.
ans=the virtual dom is a lightweight copy of the real dom this is a Instead updating the actual dom directly
react is a update virtual dom first and applies the only necessary changes to in the real dom that help reduces slow operations and ui faster.



3. What are the main differences between class components and functional components?
ans= the class component are use the ES6 and its have method lifecycle and the functional component is the simple js Function but the hook can also manage
the state also the functional component are easier to eriote and perform better than class component.



4. What is JSX, and why is it preferred over plain JavaScript?
ans=


5. Explain the concept of “one-way data flow” in React.
ans=


6. What are props in React, and how do they differ from state?
ans= the prop in the react is  inputs passed from a parent to the child component are read only and 
state is data manageing inside the component and its can  be updated props cant be changed by the component but state changed.


7. What is state management, and why is it important in React applications?
ans=the state management in handling the data to changes in the application it is a important because the ui is updates depend the state
state management keep the app in reduces the bug.



8. What are React Hooks, and why were they introduced?
ans=the react hook is build in function thet we use state and other react features in the functional component
the react hook introduced for the avoid the complex class component and reusable code.


9. Explain the purpose of the useState hook.
ans=the purpose of the useState hook is a used to create a manage state inside the functional component 
and it is a also returns a value and the function to update the value.



10. Explain the purpose of the useEffect hook and when it is used.
ans=the purpose of the useEffect hook is the runs side effects like fetching the api data update the title or setting timers
and the its run after the component renders



11. What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
and=the a controlled component is managed React stateand  the input value come for the state
and the uncontrolled component store its own data inside the dom using  instead of state


12. What is React Context, and when should you use it?
ans=the react Context is a used  to share data to many component without the passing the props manually in a every level
it ia useful  for a like a themes  language and the auth


13. Explain what lifting state up means in React and why it is important.



14. What is component re-rendering, and what causes it in React?
ans=the  rerenderind is the  happens the state and  props of a component changs in  React when  update the ui to new data


15. What is React’s reconciliation process?


16. What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React?


17. Explain the purpose of React Fragments.


18. What is the significance of the key prop in lists?
ans=

19. What is prop drilling, and how can it be avoided?



20. What is memoization in React, and why is it important?
ans=in the react memoization is saves the result of the function so is doesnot  run again the unnecessarily
in react it also avoid the a unwanted re renders and performance of speeds



21. Explain what React Router is and why it is used.
ans=the react router is a library use for the navigation in react app it is a help tho create single page application changing components
based on the url without refreshing the page 


22. What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React, and what benefits does it provide?
ans=the server side rendering isthe rendering react component on the server instead of the browser it is a improves load the initial page and faster
 and the give better perform on slow devices browser


23. Explain the concept of lazy loading in React.
ans= the concept of the lazy loading in react is the means loading the component only it is needed
it is reduces the size and improves initial loading time



24. What is Redux, and why is it used alongside React?
ans= the redux is a state management library is used to store application wide data in one place 
it is used with React to manage complex state for in large applications


25. What are React performance optimization techniques you can apply in large applications?
ans=the react performance optimization techniques are is the use memo to avoid the unnecessary re reders in the application
and the another is the useCallback that hepl to the useMemo to memoize the function and value and we can used also a Split the code in to a samaller bundles
that can also help that is some techniques
